  "A low Earth orbit (LEO) typically ranges from 160 km to 2,000 km above Earth.",
  "The International Space Station orbits Earth roughly every 90 minutes.",
  "SpaceX’s Falcon 9 first stage can land propulsively for reuse.",
  "The Kármán line, at 100 km altitude, is commonly used to define the edge of space.",
  "Geostationary orbit sits about 35,786 km above Earth’s equator.",
  "Satellites must reach about 7.8 km/s to achieve a stable low Earth orbit.",
  "The Apollo missions used the Saturn V, the most powerful rocket ever flown.",
  "Atmospheric density drops exponentially with altitude; most air is within ~20 km of the surface.",
  "Orbital velocity decreases with altitude because gravity weakens with distance.",
  "A Hohmann transfer is an efficient way to move between circular orbits."
