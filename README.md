# Mini Orbital Launch Game

Educational web-based rocket simulation game that teaches programming concepts and orbital mechanics.

## 🐳 Docker Development Setup (REQUIRED)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: This project MUST be run using Docker. Do NOT attempt to run tests, dev server, or build commands locally. All development should be done through Docker containers to ensure consistent environment and dependencies.**

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed

### Quick Start

**First time setup (choose one):**

**Option 1: Automated setup (recommended)**
```bash
# Linux/Mac
./setup.sh

# Windows
setup.bat
```

**Option 2: Manual setup**
```bash
docker-compose build game-base
```

**Daily development commands:**

1. **Development server (ALWAYS use this):**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up game-dev
   ```
   Game will be available at http://localhost:9876

2. **Run tests (ALWAYS use this):**
   ```bash
   docker-compose run --rm game-test
   ```

3. **Watch tests during development:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose run --rm game-test-watch
   ```

4. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose run --rm game-dev npm run build
   ```

5. **Code formatting and linting:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose run --rm game-dev npm run format
   docker-compose run --rm game-dev npm run lint
   ```

### Development Workflow

- **One-time setup**: Build the base image with `docker-compose build game-base`
- **Daily development**: Use `docker-compose up game-dev` for development server
- **Fast testing**: Use `docker-compose run --rm game-test` for quick test runs
- The development server runs with hot reload
- Source code is mounted as a volume for instant updates
- Node modules are cached in a Docker volume for faster rebuilds
- All dependencies are managed within the container
- **No rebuilding needed** unless package.json changes

### Rebuilding (only when needed)

Only rebuild the Docker image when:
- package.json dependencies change
- Dockerfile is modified
- You want to update the base Node.js version

```bash
docker-compose build game-base --no-cache  # Force rebuild if needed
```

### ❌ DO NOT RUN LOCALLY

**Never run these commands directly on your host machine:**
- ❌ `npm test` 
- ❌ `npm run dev`
- ❌ `npm run build`
- ❌ `vitest`

**Always use the Docker equivalents above instead.**
